" This script defines command REPL which is prompt-driven. REPL 
" command does not take arguments. It prompts for:
" 1) string to replace. You can use * here for current word under cursor,
"    / for current search pattern. Simply Enter means current search pattern, too.
" 2) string to repalce to. Empty string means empty string here.
" 3) Substitution flags:
"     (i) ignorecase (m) matchCase
"     (w) as word    (c) confirm    (f) in files
"    Default flags are 'mw' - match-case and whole-word substitution.
"
" If you include f in flags, you are additionally prompted for
" file patterns (space-separated). Examples: (1) *.c *.h (2)  **.[ch]
" '**' in file patterns means recursive file matching.
"
" Press Ctrl-C at any prompt to abort the script.
"
" That's all.

" Todo & wishes:
" - print "No substitutions" when there were no substitutions. Currently,
"   nothing is printed where nothing was substituted.
